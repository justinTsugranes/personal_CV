## Back in my day, we just had the telephone and dial-up internet. Here are all of the ways you can reach me now, but really I almost always everything set to _do-not-disturb_ so I can get some work done

## Summary

About Me:
I'm currently focused on React Front End Development
I'm fascinated with the major developments being made with cloud computing, machine learning, smart contracts, DeFi, tokenized assets, blockchain use-cases, and augemented reality.
In my free-time, I'm also learning Solidity, Hardhat, ethers.js, and the Graph in order to itegrate DApps with the Google Cloud through Chainlink.
Before I began coding, I was helping production companies produce commercials for the Super Bowl.

Completely Aside From Tech...
writing songs, swing trading, chilling in hot sprngs, backgammon, live shows and events, photography, hiking, camping, backpacking, trail-running, road trips, non-fiction books-audiobooks-podcasts-vlogs-blogs, sailing, snorkeling, and learning Tai Chi.

Fun Fact
I blew my right hand up with dynamite when I was 9 (for real it took 120 stitches to put it back together). I went on to obtain a Master's Degree in Jazz Guitar and then became a guitarist for the US Army and a recording artist. Check out My Audible Account.
