## _Front-End Web Developer, and Digital Media Creator based in Los Angeles, California_

Back in my day, we just had the telephone and dial-up internet. Here are all of the ways you can reach me now, but e-mail is the quickest.... I check it on Monday mornings and Wednesday Afternoons and I leave everything else set to _do not disturb_

### About Me

- I'm currently focused on Next.js and React.js Front End Development and UX/UI Design with Figma.
- I'm fascinated with the major developments being made with cloud computing, machine learning, smart contracts, DeFi, tokenized assets, blockchain use-cases, and augmented reality, but I'm taking all of that one-step-at-a-time since it's a little bit much to try to digest all at once...

### Completely Aside From Tech

- writing songs, trading, backgammon, live shows and events, photography, hiking, camping, backpacking, trail-running, road trips, non-fiction books-audiobooks-podcasts-vlogs-blogs, sailing, snorkeling, and diving into artistic rabbit holes.

### Fun Facts

- Before I began coding, I was helping production companies with commercials for the 2021 Super Bowl.
- I blew my right hand up with dynamite when I was 9 (no joke... it took 120 stitches to put it back together). I went on to obtain a Master's Degree in Jazz Guitar and then became a guitarist for the US Army and a recording artist.
